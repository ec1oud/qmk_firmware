# ecloud QWERTY, a familiar and powerful layout #

Like Ordinary, this layout maintains many key positions from common QWERTY keyboards.

However, it has some common programming-related keys along the bottom row, and
a dedicated Compose key.  The vertical keys near the center are arrow keys.
The top-left keys on both halves are combo accent-grave and function-toggle keys,
because they are near the numbers, so it's convenient to hold one of them to
get a function key quickly.  There's also a function-toggle key at the
lower left corner.  The Control key is in the Sun position (what would be
caps lock for the muggles), and if tapped, acts as an esc key; but there's
also a dedicated esc key, and a dedicated right-control key.
